Customer Support Automation for Banking using Salesforce Service Cloud
This project is a comprehensive solution built on the Salesforce platform to automate and streamline the customer support processes for a modern bank.

1. Problem Statement
The banking industry deals with millions of customer interactions every month, ranging from simple service requests to critical complaints. Many banks rely on legacy systems and manual logging of requests, which leads to significant delays, inconsistent customer experiences, and a lack of real-time performance metrics for managers. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between high customer expectations and actual service delivery by implementing an intelligent, automated system.
2. Solution Overview
This project leverages the power of Salesforce Service Cloud to create a robust and efficient customer service application. The solution captures customer requests from multiple channels, automatically categorizes and routes them to the correct support queue, and provides managers with real-time dashboards to monitor agent productivity and service quality. Key processes, such as handling high-priority transaction disputes, are automated to ensure timely resolution and improve customer satisfaction.
3. Key Features and Implementation
Data Model & Security
>The standard Case object was customized with new fields like Case Sub-Category and Product Type to capture banking-specific details.
>A custom object,Loan Application, was created to manage loan requests separately.
>A security model was established using a Role Hierarchy (Bank Manager > Agent) and custom Profiles.
>The Organization-Wide Default for the Case object was set to Private to ensure data confidentiality.
Process Automation
>A Record-Triggered Flow was built to automatically route new cases to the correct support team (Card Support Queue or Loan Support Queue) based on the case sub-category.
>An Escalation Rule was created to automatically reassign unresolved, high-priority "Transaction Dispute" cases to the Bank Manager after 3 hours to ensure Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance.
Apex Development
>An Apex Trigger (CasePriorityTrigger) was developed to automatically set the Priority of all new "Transaction Dispute" cases to "High" upon creation.
>A comprehensive Test Class was written to ensure the trigger functions correctly and meets the 75% code coverage requirement.
User Interface (UI)
>A custom Lightning App named "Banking Service Console" was built to provide a dedicated and efficient workspace for the support team.
>A custom Home Page was designed and assigned to the app, featuring a real-time performance dashboard for managers.
Reporting & Dashboards
>Custom Reports were created to track key metrics, such as "Cases by Sub-Category" and "Cases by Agent".
>A Dashboard named "Banking Service Dashboard" was created to visualize this data with charts, providing managers with at-a-glance insights into team performance.
